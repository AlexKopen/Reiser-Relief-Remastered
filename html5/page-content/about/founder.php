        Bernard Reiser was born in 1924 to Aloys and Ottilia Reiser, farmers living in Wayzata, Minnesota. He was
        ordained to
        the priesthood on June 4, 1949 and was assigned to St. Mary of the Lake Parish in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. In
        1964,
        Archbishop Leo Binz asked Father Reiser to start a parish in the quickly-growing Minneapolis suburb of Coon
        Rapids.
        Seventy acres of farmland was acquired for the new church, which was named Epiphany after the great feast day of
        our
        Lord. Father Reiser's vision for the new parish was to see it become a home for people from conception to
        natural
        death.

        Under Father Reiser's leadership, Epiphany grew to be one of the largest Catholic communities in Minnesota,
        totaling
        almost 20,000 people. In addition to the church, the Epiphany campus includes an elementary school, a Perpetual
        Adoration chapel, a senior housing complex, an assisted living facility, a cemetery, prayer garden, Stations of
        the
        Cross, and an outdoor shrine.

        In 1996, Father Reiser traveled to Haiti for the first time. “I have seen slums in China, Egypt and Mexico
        City,” he
        wrote. “None of them compare to the tragic realities of the slums outside Port au Prince.” Father Reiser was
        profoundly impacted by his first experience in Haiti and resolved to spend the rest of his life raising
        awareness
        about the level of poverty in the country and alleviating the suffering of the poor. This was the beginning of
        Reiser
        Relief.

        Father Reiser returned to Haiti multiple times, where he started an elementary school, a home for the elderly,
        and a
        water truck ministry that provides clean water free of charge to residents of Cite Soleil, the poorest slum in
        the
        Western Hemisphere.
        <br><br>
        After 62 years of dedicated priesthood, Father Bernard Reiser went to the Lord on December 27, 2011 at the age
        of 86.
        Thousands of people mourned the passing of a beloved friend, mentor and pastor.
        <br><br>
        Reiser Relief carries on the legacy of Father Reiser by continuing the work he started in Haiti. Since our
        founding,
        the organization has grown to support four primary schools, three homes for the elderly, one home for disabled
        adults,
        one trade school, one water truck ministry, and one university scholarship program. We thank God for the life of
        Father Reiser, a visionary who made the world a better place.
